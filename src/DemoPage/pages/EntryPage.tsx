            Flip Entry Module are very common and powerful method in smart money concept . when
            Price tap on HTF Supply Zone then you have to switch into Lower time frame as per our
            Multiple Time Frame correlation . You have to switch into LTF and wait for confirmation if
            price not break directly prev recent high / low as a CHoCH and take some small pullback on
            Order Block and not able to hold OB and failed . so this process is called Flip when Demand
            convert into supply D2S or Supply Convert into Demand S2D . Lets understand by given
            diagram and Example .

            CHoCH is first indication for reversal and you'll see two type entry during Change of
            character first one is CHoCH with inducement and second entry CHoCH Without inducement
            in this case no need inducement structure just sweep the previous low / High and we can
            enter as per our entry module and same thing applicable in bullish and bearish condition. lets
            understand by given diagrams and examples .

            When Price tap on Higher time frame POI and give small reaction in terms of structure and
            recet Order Block and give small reaction and failed to hold supply and finally break and
            create new demand / OB then you have to wait for IDM or Demand sweep for buy
            confirmation because liquidity is important . after taken out Liquidity we can Buy / Sell Here .

            Sweep and Single candle mitigation mostly work on similar Liquidity . Taken out Major High
            and Low thats is called Liquidity Sweep and Taken our Prev Candle High and Low that's
            called Single Candle Mitigation Entry . and You can also take entry on single candle Order
            Block based . Price must be tap on LTF POI then you can take Single candle Mitigation entry.

            When you start play on both side move major and minor thats is Ping Pong Entries . These
            types of entries are really toughest because few peoples can think in both side and main
            thing to take action for buy and sell BUT I'll make you some easy to understand things which
            will help you a lot to understand that where and when you should enter ot not . if you don't
            like to play both side then you can leave or avoid because it's not means that only Ping Pong
            traders can make money only. majority focus on you're strong side , for example me I like to
            trade SHORT (Sell ) Market . Majority of the time i Sell Market and few times I bought .to
            trade ping Pong first you have to identify your POI and reaction Zone / POI / Point . when
            market tap on your POI then identify on which level can market react and how you'll react if
            same thing happen as you planned . lets understand by few examples below .
        </Typography.Paragraph>
        <img src={img43}/>
        <img src={img44}/>
        <Typography.Paragraph>
            Always remember 2 things during Entries to identify Ping Pong, First things identify structure
            and if structure is bearish then always Buy on Demand or Prev Low Sweep and this buy will be
            short term Buy . if price tap on Supply or sweep any session high then hold for Longer run and
            sell in LTF Confirmation. same rules will be applicable in Bullish market if market taken out
            High then then sell for short term and Buy when price taken out Low or tap on demand . this
            Buy will be High Probability Buy .
